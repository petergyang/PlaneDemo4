# Plane vs UFOs

A 3D game where you control a plane to shoot down UFOs hovering over a city.

## Requirements

- 3D environment with a city landscape
- Player-controlled airplane with shooting capability
- UFO enemies that hover over the city
- Collision detection for bullets, UFOs, and the plane
- Visual effects for explosions
- Game states: start screen, gameplay, victory, and lose conditions
- Sound effects and background music
